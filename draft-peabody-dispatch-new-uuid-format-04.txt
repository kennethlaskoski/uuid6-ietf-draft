Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                    May 2022


1.  Introduction

   Many things have changed in the time since UUIDs were originally
   created.  Modern applications have a need to create and utilize UUIDs
   as the primary identifier for a variety of different items in complex
   computational systems, including but not limited to database keys,
   file names, machine or system names, and identifiers for event-driven
   transactions.

   One area UUIDs have gained popularity is as database keys.  This
   stems from the increasingly distributed nature of modern
   applications.  In such cases, "auto increment" schemes often used by
   databases do not work well, as the effort required to coordinate
   unique numeric identifiers across a network can easily become a
   burden.  The fact that UUIDs can be used to create unique, reasonably
   short values in distributed systems without requiring synchronization
   makes them a good alternative, but UUID versions 1-5 lack certain
   other desirable characteristics:

   1.  Non-time-ordered UUID versions such as UUIDv4 have poor database
       index locality.  Meaning new values created in succession are not
       close to each other in the index and thus require inserts to be
       performed at random locations.  The negative performance effects
       of which on common structures used for this (B-tree and its
       variants) can be dramatic.

   2.  The 100-nanosecond, Gregorian epoch used in UUIDv1 timestamps is
       uncommon and difficult to represent accurately using a standard
       number format such as [IEEE754].

   3.  Introspection/parsing is required to order by time sequence; as
       opposed to being able to perform a simple byte-by-byte
       comparison.

   4.  Privacy and network security issues arise from using a MAC
       address in the node field of Version 1 UUIDs.  Exposed MAC
       addresses can be used as an attack surface to locate machines and
       reveal various other information about such machines (minimally
       manufacturer, potentially other details).  Additionally, with the
       advent of virtual machines and containers, MAC address uniqueness
       is no longer guaranteed.

   5.  Many of the implementation details specified in [RFC4122] involve
       trade offs that are neither possible to specify for all
       applications nor necessary to produce interoperable
       implementations.

   6.  [RFC4122] does not distinguish between the requirements for
       generation of a UUID versus an application which simply stores
       one, which are often different.

   Due to the aforementioned issue, many widely distributed database
   applications and large application vendors have sought to solve the
   problem of creating a better time-based, sortable unique identifier
   for use as a database key.  This has lead to numerous implementations
   over the past 10+ years solving the same problem in slightly
   different ways.

   While preparing this specification the following 16 different
   implementations were analyzed for trends in total ID length, bit
   Layout, lexical formatting/encoding, timestamp type, timestamp
   format, timestamp accuracy, node format/components, collision
   handling and multi-timestamp tick generation sequencing.

   An inspection of these implementations and the issues described above
   has led to this document which attempts to adapt UUIDs to address
   these issues.

   For UUID version 6, 7 and 8 the variant field placement from
   [RFC4122] are unchanged.  An example version/variant layout for
   UUIDv6 follows the table where M is the version and N is the variant.

   00000000-0000-6000-8000-000000000000

5.  New Formats

   The UUID format is 16 octets; the variant bits in conjunction with
   the version bits described in the next section in determine finer
   structure.

5.1.  UUID Version 6

   UUID version 6 is a field-compatible version of UUIDv1, reordered for
   improved DB locality.  It is expected that UUIDv6 will primarily be
   used in contexts where there are existing v1 UUIDs.  Systems that do
   not involve legacy UUIDv1 SHOULD consider using UUIDv7 instead.

   Instead of splitting the timestamp into the low, mid and high
   sections from UUIDv1, UUIDv6 changes this sequence so timestamp bytes
   are stored from most to least significant.  That is, given a 60 bit
   timestamp value as specified for UUIDv1 in [RFC4122], Section 4.1.4,
   for UUIDv6, the first 48 most significant bits are stored first,
   followed by the 4 bit version (same position), followed by the
   remaining 12 bits of the original 60 bit timestamp.

   The clock sequence bits remain unchanged from their usage and
   position in [RFC4122], Section 4.1.5.

   The 48 bit node SHOULD be set to a pseudo-random value however
   implementations MAY choose to retain the old MAC address behavior
   from [RFC4122], Section 4.1.6 and [RFC4122], Section 4.5.  For more
   information on MAC address usage within UUIDs see the Section 8

   The format for the 16-byte, 128 bit UUIDv6 is shown in Figure 1

      version (0110) while the remaining 12 bits will contain the least

      bits 48 through 63 (octets 6-7)

   clk_seq_hi_res:
      The first two bits MUST be set to the UUID variant (10) The
      remaining 6 bits contain the high portion of the clock sequence.
      Occupies bits 64 through 71 (octet 8)

      through 79 (octet 9)

   node:

      (octets 10-15)

   With UUIDv6 the steps for splitting the timestamp into time_high and
   time_mid are OPTIONAL since the 48 bits of time_high and time_mid
   will remain in the same order.  An extra step of splitting the first
   48 bits of the timestamp into the most significant 32 bits and least
   significant 16 bits proves useful when reusing an existing UUIDv1
   implementation.

5.2.  UUID Version 7

   UUID version 7 features a time-ordered value field derived from the
   widely implemented and well known Unix Epoch timestamp source, the
   number of milliseconds seconds since midnight 1 Jan 1970 UTC, leap
   seconds excluded.  As well as improved entropy characteristics over
   versions 1 or 6.

   Implementations SHOULD utilize UUID version 7 over UUID version 1 and
   6 if possible.

5.3.  UUID Version 8

   UUID version 8 provides an RFC-compatible format for experimental or
   vendor-specific use cases.  The only requirement is that the variant
   and version bits MUST be set as defined in Section 4.  UUIDv8's
   uniqueness will be implementation-specific and SHOULD NOT be assumed.

   The only explicitly defined bits are the Version and Variant leaving
   122 bits for implementation specific time-based UUIDs.  To be clear:
   UUIDv8 is not a replacement for UUIDv4 where all 122 extra bits are
   filled with random data.

   Some example situations in which UUIDv8 usage could occur:

   *  An implementation would like to embed extra information within the
      UUID other than what is defined in this document.

   *  An implementation has other application/language restrictions
      which inhibit the use of one of the current UUIDs.

5.4.  Max UUID

   The Max UUID is special form of UUID that is specified to have all
   128 bits set to 1.  This UUID can be thought of as the inverse of Nil
   UUID defined in [RFC4122], Section 4.1.7

   FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF

6.  UUID Best Practices

   The minimum requirements for generating UUIDs are described in this
   document for each version.  Everything else is an implementation
   detail and up to the implementer to decide what is appropriate for a
   given implementation.  That being said, various relevant factors are
   covered below to help guide an implementer through the different
   trade-offs among differing UUID implementations.

6.1.  Timestamp Granularity

   UUID timestamp source, precision and length was the topic of great
   debate while creating this specification.  As such choosing the right
   timestamp for your application is a very important topic.  This
   section will detail some of the most common points on this topic.

   Reliability:
      Implementations SHOULD use the current timestamp from a reliable
      source to provide values that are time-ordered and continually
      increasing.  Care SHOULD be taken to ensure that timestamp changes
      from the environment or operating system are handled in a way that
      is consistent with implementation requirements.  For example, if
      it is possible for the system clock to move backward due to either
      manual adjustment or corrections from a time synchronization
      protocol, implementations must decide how to handle such cases.
      (See Altering, Fuzzing, or Smearing bullet below.)

   Source:
      UUID version 1 and 6 both utilize a Gregorian epoch timestamp
      while UUIDv7 utilizes a Unix Epoch timestamp.  If other timestamp
      sources or a custom timestamp epoch are required UUIDv8 SHOULD be
      leveraged.

Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                    May 2022


   Sub-second Precision and Accuracy:
      Many levels of precision exist for timestamps: milliseconds,
      microseconds, nanoseconds, and beyond.  Additionally fractional
      representations of sub-second precision may be desired to mix
      various levels of precision in a time-ordered manner.
      Furthermore, system clocks themselves have an underlying
      granularity and it is frequently less than the precision offered
      by the operating system.  With UUID version 1 and 6,
      100-nanoseconds of precision are present while UUIDv7 features
      fixed millisecond level of precision within the Unix epoch that
      does not exceed the granularity capable in most modern systems.
      For other levels of precision UUIDv8 SHOULD be utilized.

   Length:
      The length of a given timestamp directly impacts how long a given
      UUID will be valid.  That is, how many timestamp ticks can be
      contained in a UUID before the maximum value for the timestamp
      field is reached.  Care should be given to ensure that the proper
      length is selected for a given timestamp.  UUID version 1 and 6
      utilize a 60 bit timestamp and UUIDv7 features a 48 bit timestamp.

   Altering, Fuzzing, or Smearing:
      Implementations MAY alter the actual timestamp.  Some examples
      included security considerations around providing a real clock
      value within a UUID, to correct inaccurate clocks or to handle
      leap seconds.  This specification makes no requirement or
      guarantee about how close the clock value needs to be to actual
      time.

   Padding:
      When timestamp padding is required, implementations MUST pad the
      most significant bits (left-most) bits with zeros.  An example is
      padding the most significant, left-most bits of a 32 bit Unix
      timestamp with zero's to fill out the 48 bit timestamp in UUIDv7.

   Truncating:
      Similarly, when timestamps need to be truncated: the lower, least
      significant bits MUST be used.  An example would be truncating a
      64 bit Unix timestamp to the least significant, right-most 48 bits
      for UUIDv7.

6.2.  Monotonicity and Counters

   Monotonicity is the backbone of time-based sortable UUIDs.  Naturally
   time-based UUIDs from this document will be monotonic due to an
   embedded timestamp however implementations can guarantee additional
   monotonicity via the concepts covered in this section.

Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                    May 2022


   Additionally, care MUST be taken to ensure UUIDs generated in batches
   are also monotonic.  That is, if one-thousand UUIDs are generated for
   the same timestamp; there is sufficient logic for organizing the
   creation order of those one-thousand UUIDs.  For batch UUID creation
   implementions MAY utilize a monotonic counter which SHOULD increment
   for each UUID created during a given timestamp.

   For single-node UUID implementations that do not need to create
   batches of UUIDs, the embedded timestamp within UUID version 1, 6,
   and 7 can provide sufficient monotonicity guarantees by simply
   ensuring that timestamp increments before creating a new UUID.  For
   the topic of Distributed Nodes please refer to Section 6.3

   Implementations SHOULD choose one method for single-node UUID
   implementations that require batch UUID creation.

   Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Bits (Method 1):
      This references the practice of allocating a specific number of
      bits in the UUID layout to the sole purpose of tallying the total
      number of UUIDs created during a given UUID timestamp tick.
      Positioning of a fixed bit-length counter SHOULD be immediatly
      after the embedded timestamp.  This promotes sortability and
      allows random data generation for each counter increment.  With
      this method rand_a section of UUIDv7 SHOULD be utilized as fixed-
      length dedicated counter bits that are incremented by one for
      every UUID generation.  The trailing random bits generated for
      each new UUID in rand_b can help produce unguessable UUIDs.  In
      the event more counter bits are required the most significant,
      left-most, bits of rand_b MAY be leveraged as additional counter
      bits.

   Monotonic Random (Method 2):
      With this method the random data is extended to also double as a
      counter.  This monotonic random can be thought of as a "randomly
      seeded counter" which MUST be incremented in the least significant
      position for each UUID created on a given timestamp tick.
      UUIDv7's rand_b section SHOULD be utilized with this method to
      handle batch UUID generation during a single timestamp tick.  The
      increment value for every UUID generation SHOULD be a random
      integer of any desired length larger than zero.  It ensures the
      UUIDs retain the required level of unguessability characters
      provided by the underlying entropy.  The increment value MAY be
      one when the amount of UUIDs generated in a particular period of
      time is important and guessability is not an issue.  However, it
      SHOULD NOT be used by implementations that favor unguessiblity, as
      the resulting values are easily guessable.

   The following sub-topics cover topics related solely with creating
   reliable fixed-length dedicated counters:

   Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Seeding:
      Implementations utilizing fixed-length counter method SHOULD
      randomly initialize the counter with each new timestamp tick.
      However, when the timestamp has not incremented; the counter
      SHOULD be frozen and incremented via the desired increment logic.
      When utilizing a randomly seeded counter alongside Method 1; the
      random MAY be regenerated with each counter increment without
      impacting sortability.  The downside is that Method 1 is prone to
      overflows if a counter of adequate length is not selected or the
      random data generated leaves little room for the required number
      of increments.  Implementations utilizing fixed-length counter
      method MAY also choose to randomly initialize a portion counter
      rather than the entire counter.  For example, a 24 bit counter
      could have the 23 bits in least-significant, right-most, position
      randomly initialized.  The remaining most significant, left-most
      counter bits are initialized as zero for the sole purpose of
      guarding against counter rollovers.

   Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Length:
      Care MUST be taken to select a counter bit-length that can
      properly handle the level of timestamp precision in use.  For
      example, millisecond precision SHOULD require a larger counter
      than a timestamp with nanosecond precision.  General guidance is
      that the counter SHOULD be at least 12 bits but no longer than 42
      bits.  Care SHOULD also be given to ensure that the counter length
      selected leaves room for sufficient entropy in the random portion
      of the UUID after the counter.  This entropy helps improve the
      unguessability characteristics of UUIDs created within the batch.

   The following sub-topics cover rollover handling with either type of
   counter method:

   Counter Rollover Guards:
      The technique from Fixed-Length Dedicated Counter Seeding which
      describes allocating a segment of the fixed-length counter as a
      rollover guard is also recommended and SHOULD be employed to help
      mitigate counter rollover issues.  This same technique can be
      leveraged with Monotonic random counter methods by ensuring the
      total length of a possible increment in the least significant,
      right most position is less than the total length of the random
      being incremented.  As such the most significant, left-most, bits
      can be incremented as rollover guarding.

Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                    May 2022


   Counter Rollover Handling:
      Counter rollovers SHOULD be handled by the application to avoid
      sorting issues.  The general guidance is that applications that
      care about absolute monotonicity and sortability SHOULD freeze the
      counter and wait for the timestamp to advance which ensures
      monotonicity is not broken.  Alternatively, implementations MAY
      increment the timestamp ahead of the actual time and reinitialize
      the counter.

   Implementations MAY use the following logic to ensure UUIDs featuring
   embedded counters are monotonic in nature:

   1.  Compare the current timestamp against the previously stored
       timestamp.
   2.  If the current timestamp is equal to the previous timestamp;
       increment the counter according to the desired method.
   3.  If the current timestamp is greater than the previous timestamp;
       re-initialize the desired counter method to the new timestamp and
       generate new random bytes (if the bytes were frozen or being used
       as the seed for a monotonic counter).

   Implementations SHOULD check if the the currently generated UUID is
   greater than the previously generated UUID.  If this is not the case
   then any number of things could have occurred.  Such as, but not
   limited to, clock rollbacks, leap second handling or counter
   rollovers.  Applications SHOULD embed sufficient logic to catch these
   scenarios and correct the problem ensuring the next UUID generated is
   greater than the previous.  To handle this scenario, the general
   guidance is that application MAY reuse the previous timestamp and
   increment the previous counter method.

6.3.  Distributed UUID Generation

   Some implementations MAY desire to utilize multi-node, clustered,
   applications which involve two or more nodes independently generating
   UUIDs that will be stored in a common location.  While UUIDs already
   feature sufficient entropy to ensure that the chances of collision
   are low as the total number of nodes increase; so does the likelihood
   of a collision.  This section will detail the approaches that MAY be
   utilized by multi-node UUID implementations in distributed
   environments.

Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                    May 2022


   Centralized Registry:
      With this method all nodes tasked with creating UUIDs consult a
      central registry and confirm the generated value is unique.  As
      applications scale the communication with the central registry
      could become a bottleneck and impact UUID generation in a negative
      way.  Utilization of shared knowledge schemes with central/global
      registries is outside the scope of this specification.

   Node IDs:
      With this method, a pseudo-random Node ID value is placed within
      the UUID layout.  This identifier helps ensure the bit-space for a
      given node is unique, resulting in UUIDs that do not conflict with
      any other UUID created by another node with a different node id.
      Implementations that choose to leverage an embedded node id SHOULD
      utilize UUIDv8.  The node id SHOULD NOT be an IEEE 802 MAC address
      as per Section 8.  The location and bit length are left to
      implementations and are outside the scope of this specification.
      Furthermore, the creation and negotiation of unique node ids among
      nodes is also out of scope for this specification.

   Utilization of either a Centralized Registry or Node ID are not
   required for implementing UUIDs in this specification.  However
   implementations SHOULD utilize one of the two aforementioned methods
   if distributed UUID generation is a requirement.

6.4.  Collision Resistance

   Implementations SHOULD weigh the consequences of UUID collisions
   within their application and when deciding between UUID versions that
   use entropy (random) versus the other components such as Section 6.1
   and Section 6.2.  This is especially true for distributed node
   collision resistance as defined by Section 6.3.

   There are two example scenarios below which help illustrate the
   varying seriousness of a collision within an application.

   Low Impact
      A UUID collision generated a duplicate log entry which results in
      incorrect statistics derived from the data.  Implementations that
      are not negatively affected by collisions may continue with the
      entropy and uniqueness provided by the traditional UUID format.

Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                    May 2022


   High Impact:
      A duplicate key causes an airplane to receive the wrong course
      which puts people's lives at risk.  In this scenario there is no
      margin for error.  Collisions MUST be avoided and failure is
      unacceptable.  Applications dealing with this type of scenario
      MUST employ as much collision resistance as possible within the
      given application context.

6.5.  Global and Local Uniqueness

   UUIDs created by this specification MAY be used to provide local
   uniqueness guarantees.  For example, ensuring UUIDs created within a
   local application context are unique within a database MAY be
   sufficient for some implementations where global uniqueness outside
   of the application context, in other applications, or around the
   world is not required.

   Although true global uniqueness is impossible to guarantee without a
   shared knowledge scheme; a shared knowledge scheme is not required by
   UUID to provide uniqueness guarantees.  Implementations MAY implement
   a shared knowledge scheme introduced in Section 6.3 as they see fit
   to extend the uniqueness guaranteed this specification and [RFC4122].

6.6.  Unguessability

   Implementations SHOULD utilize a cryptographically secure pseudo-
   random number generator (CSPRNG) to provide values that are both
   difficult to predict ("unguessable") and have a low likelihood of
   collision ("unique").  CSPRNG ensures the best of Section 6.4 and
   Section 8 are present in modern UUIDs.

   Advice on generating cryptographic-quality random numbers can be
   found in [RFC4086]

6.7.  Sorting

   UUIDv6 and UUIDv7 are designed so that implementations that require
   sorting (e.g. database indexes) SHOULD sort as opaque raw bytes,
   without need for parsing or introspection.

   Time ordered monotonic UUIDs benefit from greater database index
   locality because the new values are near each other in the index.  As
   a result objects are more easily clustered together for better
   performance.  The real-world differences in this approach of index
   locality vs random data inserts can be quite large.

   UUIDs formats created by this specification SHOULD be
   Lexicographically sortable while in the textual representation.

Internet-Draft               new-uuid-format                    May 2022


   UUIDs created by this specification are crafted with big-ending byte
   order (network byte order) in mind.  If Little-endian style is
   required a custom UUID format SHOULD be created using UUIDv8.

6.8.  Opacity

   UUIDs SHOULD be treated as opaque values and implementations SHOULD
   NOT examine the bits in a UUID to whatever extent is possible.
   However, where necessary, inspectors should refer to Section 4 for
   more information on determining UUID version and variant.

6.9.  DBMS and Database Considerations

   For many applications, such as databases, storing UUIDs as text is
   unnecessarily verbose, requiring 288 bits to represent 128 bit UUID
   values.  Thus, where feasible, UUIDs SHOULD be stored within database
   applications as the underlying 128 bit binary value.

   For other systems, UUIDs MAY be stored in binary form or as text, as
   appropriate.  The trade-offs to both approaches are as such:

   *  Storing as binary requires less space and may result in faster
      data access.
   *  Storing as text requires more space but may require less
      translation if the resulting text form is to be used after
      retrieval and thus maybe simpler to implement.

   DBMS vendors are encouraged to provide functionality to generate and
   store UUID formats defined by this specification for use as
   identifiers or left parts of identifiers such as, but not limited to,
   primary keys, surrogate keys for temporal databases, foreign keys
   included in polymorphic relationships, and keys for key-value pairs
   in JSON columns and key-value databases.  Applications using a
   monolithic database may find using database-generated UUIDs (as
   opposed to client-generate UUIDs) provides the best UUID
   monotonicity.  In addition to UUIDs, additional identifiers MAY be
   used to ensure integrity and feedback.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

8.  Security Considerations

   MAC addresses pose inherent security risks and SHOULD not be used
   within a UUID.  Instead CSPRNG data SHOULD be selected from a source
   with sufficient entropy to ensure guaranteed uniqueness among UUID
   generation.  See Section 6.6 for more information.

   Timestamps embedded in the UUID do pose a very small attack surface.
   The timestamp in conjunction with an embedded counter does signal the
   order of creation for a given UUID and it's corresponding data but
   does not define anything about the data itself or the application as
   a whole.  If UUIDs are required for use with any security operation
   within an application context in any shape or form then [RFC4122]
   UUIDv4 SHOULD be utilized.

A.3.  Creating a UUIDv8 Value

   UUIDv8 will vary greatly from implementation to implementation.  A
   good candidate use case for UUIDv8 is to embed exotic timestamps like
   the one found in this example which employs approximately 0.25
   milliseconds and approximately 5 microseconds per timestamp tick as a
   48 bit value.

   #include <stdint.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <time.h>

   int main() {
     struct timespec tp;
     clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, &tp);
     uint64_t timestamp = (uint64_t)tp.tv_sec << 12;

     // compute 12 bit (~0.25 msec precision) fraction from nsecs
     timestamp |= ((uint64_t)tp.tv_nsec << 12) / 1000000000;

     printf("%08llx-%04llx\n", timestamp >> 16, timestamp & 0xFFFF);
     return 0;
   }

Appendix B.  Test Vectors

   Both UUIDv1 and UUIDv6 test vectors utilize the same 60 bit
   timestamp: 0x1EC9414C232AB00 (138648505420000000) Tuesday, February
   22, 2022 2:22:22.000000 PM GMT-05:00

   Both UUIDv1 and UUIDv6 utilize the same values in clk_seq_hi_res,
   clock_seq_low, and node.  All of which have been generated with
   random data.
